**Problem Statement -**
E-commerce websites like Amazon have complex user interfaces that require responsive design, intuitive navigation, and clear product presentation.  
As a front-end developer, practicing by building such a UI clone helps in understanding **HTML structure** and **CSS styling** in real-world scenarios.

**Problem Description -**
The challenge was to create a **front-end clone** of the Amazon website that:
- Looks visually similar to the real Amazon website
- Works across different devices and screen sizes
- Contains interactive UI components such as navigation menus and clickable product cards
- Is built only with **HTML and CSS** without using any frameworks
- Organizes code and assets in a clean and maintainable structure
This project focuses on **UI replication** only (no backend functionality such as payments or order processing).

**Features -**
- Responsive homepage design
- Amazon-style navigation bar
- Product listing section
- Product details layout
- Footer similar to Amazon

**Technologies Used -**
- **HTML5** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness
